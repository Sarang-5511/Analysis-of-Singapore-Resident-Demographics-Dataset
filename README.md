# Analysis-of-Singapore-Resident-Demographics-Dataset

This report investigates demographic trends in Singapore from 1957 to 2023, focusing on six key hypotheses related to age distribution, gender ratios, ethnic group growth, youth population,
elderly population growth, and the working-age population. Using inferential and descriptive
statistical methods, including linear regression and chi-square tests, the study analyzes shifts
in the population and their implications for policy-making, urban planning, and societal dynamics.

The findings of this report provide insights that are crucial for shaping future policy responses,
urban infrastructure planning, and social services, particularly in addressing the challenges
posed by an aging population, changing workforce dynamics, and evolving demographic
composition.
