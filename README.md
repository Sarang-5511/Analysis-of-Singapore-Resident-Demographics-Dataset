This report investigates demographic trends in Singapore from 1957 to 2023, focusing on six key hypotheses related to age distribution, gender ratios, ethnic group growth, youth population,
elderly population growth, and the working-age population. Using inferential and descriptive
statistical methods, including linear regression and chi-square tests, the study analyzes shifts
in the population and their implications for policy-making, urban planning, and societal dynamics.
The first hypothesis examines the age distribution, highlighting a significant shift toward an
increasing elderly proportion, especially in recent decades. The second hypothesis analyzes the
stability of gender ratios across age groups, exploring whether changes correlate with policy
interventions. The third hypothesis evaluates the growth rates among ethnic groups, influenced
by immigration and birth rate policies. The fourth hypothesis investigates the decline in the youth
population, linked to changing family planning trends. The fifth hypothesis focuses on the growth
of the elderly population, with a particular emphasis on its impact on healthcare and social
services. Finally, the sixth hypothesis examines patterns in the working-age population,
reflecting the phases of Singaporeâ€™s economic development.
The findings of this report provide insights that are crucial for shaping future policy responses,
urban infrastructure planning, and social services, particularly in addressing the challenges
posed by an aging population, changing workforce dynamics, and evolving demographic
composition.
